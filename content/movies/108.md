A British spy, played by Mike Meyers, must return to 1969 as his arch-nemesis Dr Evil has ventured back in time and successfully stolen Meyers's "mojo". After returning to the present day, he becomes a cop with a split personality who must escort a woman to New York, only to have his alter ego intervene at the most inopportune time.
